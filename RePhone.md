Mobile phones use to be very different, but now days the bulky rectangular touch screen phone all look the same, and it is not very ‘maker’ to use such phones. As the world’s first open source modular phone kits, Rephone is going to make some difference.

The reason why we name it as ‘Rephone’ is because we want to redefine the way we put our phone into use. ‘Re’ means ‘Renaissance ’. A phone does not necessary to be a bulky rectangular block that can only be used by human, it ought to have different shapes and sizes for different applications. RePhone is a set of tools and components that encourage everyone including students, teachers, makers, hackers, geeks, artists, developers and engineers to ‘redesign’ how it should look like, and ‘remix’ the modules to ‘remake’ a unique phone for our very own.

With Rephone you can:

- 	Create your own phone in minutes with the slim MODULES, accessible SOFTWARE, and customizable Phone Enclosures.
- Hack anything around you, giving inanimate objects the power of cellular communication. Have a conversation with your pets, plants, toys, motorcycle helmets, robots, or drones through RePhone’s GSM and 3G functions.

In addition to the RePhone GSM+BLE, we have created 8 add on modules to expand functionalities of RePhone, Here in the Seeed wiki, you can find single docs for every of them.
