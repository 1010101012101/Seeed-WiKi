Several weeks ago we published the Grove Shield for Intel Joule, This time, let’s introduce the incredible kit that can help you get started with Intel Joule easy and fast, the Grove maker kit for Intel Joule.

Joule is the most amazing board that Intel published for IoT project in 2016. With the embedded Linux system and rich hardware, Intel Joule can be the best choice for developers to improve their project and publish the prototyping to the market without much effort.

The Grove maker kit for Intel Joule is the best kit for fast building prototype based on Joule. The kit contains a grove bash shield for Joule, with which you can easily add the 13 grove modules that we specifically selected for Joule. If you have the Intel Joule on hand and plan to build a prototype fast, please don’t hesitate to choose the Grove maker kit for Intel Joule.

## Part Introduction

### [Grove Shield for Intel Joule](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove_Shield_for_Intel_Joule/)

The Grove Shield for Intel Joule is the key to bridge the Intel Joule to the family of Grove modules. by simplely plugging it onto your Joule board, you can have 8 solid and easy-to-use Grove connectors which includes interfaces like I2C, UART, digital I/Os and analog inputs right away. It also keeps the 2x20 pin headers in case you want more GPIOs for the project. A switch is integrated on board for selecting the working voltage at either 5V or 3.3 V.

### Grove Sensors
[Grove Button](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Button/)

A simple momentary on/off button. Connect it to any digital port on Grove Shield for Intel Joule to use it as an input of High/Low signal to the controller.

[Grove - Sound Sensor](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Sound_Sensor/)

A sound sensor to detect the sound strength of the environment. Connect it to an anaglog connector to use the sound as incentive signal.

[Grove - Piezo Vibration Sensor](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Piezo_Vibration_Sensor/)

It allows you to measure vibration, impact and touch. Connect it to any digital connector on Grove Shield for Intel Joule to receive High signal when vibration is detected.

[Grove - Light Sensor](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Light_Sensor/)

Compared to conventional Light Dependent Resistor(LDR), the use of phototransistor not only boosts the reliability and sensibility, but also increases the measuring light spectrum. The module outputs analog signals, an 8-bit Analog-Digital-Converter(ADC) would convert it to a range of 0-255.

[Grove - Temperature Sensor](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Temperature_Sensor/)

Uses a thermistor to detect the ambient temperature(range:-40~+125℃)， and outputs an analog signal connect it to an analog connector.

[Grove - Touch Sensor](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Touch_Sensor/)

It can detect the change in capacitance when a finger is nearby. You can use it as a button that allows you to replace press with touch. Connect it to any digital connector on Grove Shield for Intel Joule.

<a href="http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Rotary_Angle_Sensor/">Grove - Rotary Angle Sensor(P)</a>

It can convert the analog signal(from 0 to 300 degrees) to a linear change analog output between 0 and Vcc. Connect it to an analog connector on Grove Shield for Intel Joule.



### Grove Actuators
[Grove - LCD RGB Backlight](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-LCD_RGB_Backlight/)

A simple user interface that supports user-defined characters and a colorful RGB backlight. Connect it to an I2C on Grove Shield for Intel Joule to display the information you need.


[Grove - Buzzer](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Buzzer/)

A simple buzzer with Grove connector that can connect to both digital and analog connectors. It will emit a tone when the output is HIGH. Alternatively, it can be connected to an analog pulse-width modulation output to generate various tones and effects.

[Grove - Red/Green/Blue LED](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-Red_LED/)

This is a group of simple LEDs. Connect them to any digital port on Grove Shield for Intel Joule to light them up with a HIGH output.

[Gear Stepper Motor with Driver](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Gear-Stepper-Motor-with-Driver-p-1685.html)

It allows you to drive a stepper motor by connecting the stepper motor to the driver board, and connect the driver to any digital port on Grove Shield for Intel Joule that has a PWM output. Then you can control your stepper motor easily with lines of code.
