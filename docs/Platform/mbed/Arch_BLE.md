#Arch BLE
---

##Introduction
Arch BLE is an mbed enabled development board based Nordic nRF51822. With Arduino form factor and Grove connectors, it is extremely easy to create a bluetooth low energy device.

The nRF51822 is a powerful multi-protocol single chip solution for ULP wireless applications. It incorporates Nordic’s latest best-in-class performance radio transceiver, an ARM Cortex M0 MCU and 256kB flash + 16kB RAM memory. The nRF51822 supports Bluetooth® low energy and 2.4 GHz protocol stacks.

##Pinout

##Get Started

![](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/1/10/Get_started_with_mbed.png)

1. Click [this link](https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/#import:/teams/mbed/code/mbed_blinky/;platform:Seeed-Arch-BLE) to login or signup to mbed
2. Import the mbed_blinky program
3. Click the **Compile** icon of the top toolbar to compile the program, then download a compiled hex file.
4. Drag-n-drop the downloaded hex file into the MBED disk


You can open **main.cpp** to change the program. For example, use the following code to blink the LED every 0.1s

	#include "mbed.h"

	DigitalOut led(p30);           // on-board led is connected to p30
	
	int main()
	{
	    while (true) {
	        led = !led;
	        wait(0.1);
	    }
	}


!!! note
	If you get a compiling error that 'device.h' is not find, try to update the mbed library to the latest revision in your program.

##Project

Here we share a small demo to show you how Arch BLE work. This demo is consists of the below steps:

###Hardware

You need:

* Arch BLE
* Digital RGB LED Strip
* An Android device with BLE function

###Connection

There's 3pin on the LED Strip, please connect it you Arch BLD as shown below:

###Make it Run

1. Download [BLE_Color_Pixels_Arch_BLE.hex](http://tangram.qiniudn.com/BLE_Color_Pixels_ARCH_BLE.hex)
2. Copy the hex file to the MBED disk of your Arch BLE
3. Download [the Color Pixels Android app](http://tangram.qiniudn.com/seeed_ble_color_pixels.apk)


If you want to change the program, click [this link](https://mbed.org/compiler/#import:/teams/Seeed/code/BLE_Color_Pixels/;platform:Seeed-Arch-BLE) to import the Color Pixels program to mbed online IDE.

If the BLE device is disconnected frequently, we can improve the stability by changing the BLE parameters - Advertising Duration (main.cpp), Min Interval and Max Interval (nRF51822/projectconfig.h)

	#define CFG_GAP_CONNECTION_MIN_INTERVAL_MS           20                     /**< Minimum acceptable connection interval */
	#define CFG_GAP_CONNECTION_MAX_INTERVAL_MS          200                     /**< Maximum acceptable connection interval */


##Update or Restore Firmware
The latest firmware version for the Arch BLE is v0203 built at Oct 08 2014. To check your firmware version and built date, open the MBED.HTM file of your MBED disk in a text editor.

**Changelog:**

- 2014-06-26 first version
- 2014-08-25 support to drag-n-drop hex file generated by gcc toolchain and without softdevice
- 2014-10-08 use USB EJECT INSET instead of reconnecting USB, increase intel hex data line buffer (from 64 bytes to 128 bytes)


**Known issues:**

- issues when directly downloading the hex file into the MBED disk with the Chrome browser. The reason is the Chrome will create a temporary file to save the downloading data. When using the Chrome, please save your hex file to other place and then copy it to the MBED disk.


**Firmware:**

* [firmware 0241 for Arch BLE](https://github.com/mbedmicro/DAPLink/releases/download/v0241/0241_release_package_34182e2c.zip)



To flash a new firmware:

* Hold the Arch BLE's button and power on it
* A CRP DISABLD disk will pop up
  - On Windows, replace firmware.bin with the above firmware
  - On Linux/Mac, use command: **dd if={new_firmware.bin} of={firmware.bin} conv=notrunc**
